Hello there :wave:

I’m Noé Tarbouriech, a French DevOps engineer, graduated from [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/). I previously worked at [Numalis](https://numalis.com/) as a DevOps apprentice and at [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) as an intern.

I'm passionate about topics such as **Kubernetes** (I'm a CKA), **GitOps**, **Go**, and **cloud-native technologies** in general. I enjoy learning new tools, experimenting with workflows, and this blog is where I share my experiences and lessons learned.

If you want to connect with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noe-tarbouriech/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/noetarbouriech/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always happy to help and learn from others :smile:.
