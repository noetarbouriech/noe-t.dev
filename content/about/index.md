Hello there :wave:

I’m Noé Tarbouriech, a french DevOps engineer apprentice at [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/) currently working for [Numalis](https://numalis.com/).

I'm passionate about topics such as **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, **automation**, and **cloud computing** in general. I love to learn and try new things and I hope this blog will help me share my knowledge and experiences with you.

If you want to connect with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noe-tarbouriech/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/noetarbouriech/).

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always happy to help and learn from others :smile:.
